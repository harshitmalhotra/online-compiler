# Online Compiler

## About

This is a web application developed as part of a btp project. Users can use the C, C++, Java and Python compilers.

Users can do two things:

* Write code online and compile it.
* Write code offline and submit it on this web interface for the compiler to show results.

This application was developed by [Harshit Malhotra](https://github.com/harshitmalhotra) and [Mehul Khandewal](https://github.com/18ucs096).
